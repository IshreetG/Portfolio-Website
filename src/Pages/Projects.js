  <h6> 1 - Portfolio Website</h6>
  <p>The first project that I want to talk about is the one that you are viewing right now.  
  This was definitely one of the more lengthy projects because there was a lot of learning during the process.
 Not only did I learn new web features that were implemented in my portfolio, but making the website estheticially appealing to the eye also took a lot of time.    
For example, if you scroll up and down in this page, you can see one of the features I have used called Parallax Scrolling. Parralax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content is
     moved at a different speed than the foreground content. </p>

  <p>This app includes a Pomodoro clock with a "Break" and "Work" functionality and a to-do list feature which can check off and delete items. The inspiration to 
create this app was from my personal experience. During exam season, I discovered that although I would be studying all day, I wasnâ€™t at my potential productiveness. 
So, this gave me the idea to create an app that allowed me to store all my goals for that specific time period (motivating me to do these certain tasks faster).

  <p>Using C++ I created a user interactive board game called Minesweeper. The user is able to decide the difficulty level of the game 
by choosing the desired dimensions of the board and the overall objective is to determine the hidden mines without actually exploding them. 
In the process of developing this game, I have used two dimensional arrays, bitwsise operators, functions, and more.

  <p>Using Arduino, I built the servo robot arm to pick up certain objects and drop them to designated areas.
